# I'm Matt, I code a lot of stuff.

## I'm pretty language agnostic.

Sometimes it's in JS, sometimes it's in C++, sometimes a splash of Java, really whatever gets the job done.

## I like to dabble.

I've done 3D graphics, simulators, mobile apps, websites, the occasional game, and a complete language one time.

## Code talks.

Check out my pinned, they're cool. My other stuff is also cool.
