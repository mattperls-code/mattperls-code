# I'm Matt, I code a lot of stuff.

## I program in whatever.

Sometimes it's in JS, sometimes it's in C++, sometimes a splash of Java, really whatever gets the job done.

## I like to dabble.

I've done mobile apps, 3D graphics, simulators, websites, the occasional game, and a complete language one time.

## Check the code.

Check out my pinned, they're cool. My other stuff is also cool.
